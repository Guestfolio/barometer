== now

- refactor: data-zone
- add start_time, end_time, run_time to each measurement and to weather

== soon

- make sure you can compare LocalTime to LocalDateTime in LocalTime class
- ability to force timezone lookups (use geonames), then use this data
 to do conversions
- style the demo app
- more drivers
- expand icao country_code hash
- expand weather_id country_code hash

== future

- Rdoc compatible documentation
- add uv info to current
- add moon info to current
- weather.com simple_questions improve answers (use extra data)

== bugs

- weather.com and yahoo won't return results for ICAO
  might have to remove "international", "airport", "municipal" from geocode result
  before finding weather_id

== refactoring

- Parsing dates is slow (ie Time.parse)
  for data parsing with known date/time formats, parse the
  needed information explicitly
  
  example:
  
  _parse_date(text)
    text =~ /^(\d\d\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d)/
    Time.new($3,$2,$1)
  end
