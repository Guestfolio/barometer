== now
- use Yahoo placemaker for geocoding (as exclusive, or as priority for supported conversions)

== very soon

- google geocoding terms of service indicate that "a map must be shown" ... what to do?
- driver: hamweather
- driver: metar
- improve code based on metrics
- use Geomojo to convert coords to woe_id (when no yahoo key)
- remove use of HTTParty, use Net:HTTP and Nokogiri instead

== soon

- refactor: data-zone
- methods to use service_specific icons/images

== future

- Rdoc compatible documentation
- add uv, moon, elevation info to current
- driver: intellicast
- weather.com simple_questions improve answers (use extra data)
- make sure you can compare LocalTime to LocalDateTime in LocalTime class

- be smart, never make duplicate queries
  - ie. if you are including wunderground, do it first and use the timezone info

- conversion and weather fetching queries should have hooks to allow
  for configurable caching via memcache, then web service calls can 
  be cached across multiple measurement instances.

== bugs

== refactoring

- Parsing dates is slow (ie Time.parse)
  for data parsing with known date/time formats, parse the
  needed information explicitly

  example:

  _parse_date(text)
    text =~ /^(\d\d\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d)/
    Time.new($3,$2,$1)
  end
