== soon

- style the demo app results
- more drivers
- expand icao country_code hash
- expand weather_id country_code hash
- refactor: data-zone

== future

- Rdoc compatible documentation
- add uv info to current
- add moon info to current
- add elevation info to current (station and location)
- weather.com simple_questions improve answers (use extra data)
- methods to use service_specific icons/images
- make sure you can compare LocalTime to LocalDateTime in LocalTime class

- be smart, never make duplicate queries
  - ie. if you are including wunderground, do it first and use the timezone info
    
- conversion and weather fetching queries should have hooks to allow
  for configurable caching via memcache, then web service calls can 
  be cached across multiple measurement instances.

== bugs

== refactoring

- Parsing dates is slow (ie Time.parse)
  for data parsing with known date/time formats, parse the
  needed information explicitly
  
  example:
  
  _parse_date(text)
    text =~ /^(\d\d\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d)/
    Time.new($3,$2,$1)
  end
